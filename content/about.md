The site is my notebook on the Internet. Its content is an erratic smorgasbord, featuring daily life, hobbies and things I learn that could be of interest to others.

Content will go on the site in whatever state is convenient for me - which includes early drafts, half-thoughts and questions I want to come back and answer. It will be polished enough for its purpose (which is to say, it may not be very polished).

The site is intended to be a fun, creative outlet for me. I have no formal training with these tools, nor is it how I make a living, so I bring the amateurâ€™s expertise, accuracy and timeliness.

There will be no logging in. There will be no advertising. There is some CSS - to make a responsive and accessible design. there are unlikely to be cookies, but there is a tiny bit of JavaScript to make things nifty.
