Canberra is Australia's capital city and the seat of government. It is [located between Sydney and Melbourne](https://osm.org/go/uNlQekE-?node=21674637), on the country of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri peoples.

## geography

Canberra is at around 600 metres above sea level and just south of NSW's Southern Highlands, sheltered from the West by the Brindabellas and the East by the Great Dividing Range.

## climate

The Bureau of Meterology maintain climate statistics for Canberra and the surrounding region.

- The current weather station for us is [Canberra Airport](http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDN60903/IDN60903.94926.shtml).

Though Canberra does generally have excellent [air quality](https://www.act.gov.au/health/topics/air-quality-and-pollen/check-current-air-quality-readings-in-the-act), affected most commonly by smoke from bushfires and old wood fireplaces being trapped by cloud and cold air.

Under the KÃ¶ppen-Geiger classification, Canberra has subtropical highland climate with uniform rainfall (Cfb). From Wikipedia:

    _Subtropical highland climates with uniform rainfall (Cfb) are a type of oceanic climate mainly found in the highlands of Australia, such as in or around the Great Dividing Range in the north of the state of New South Wales, and also sparsely in other continents, such as in South America, among others. Unlike a typical Cwb climate, they tend to have rainfall spread evenly throughout the year. They have characteristics of both the Cfb and Cfa climates, but unlike these climates, they have a high diurnal temperature variation and low humidity, owing to their inland location and relatively high elevation._

### for gardening

Canberra's climate is also a pretty difficult place to garden. The temperature range is quite large, with hot, baking Summers with limited rainfall and frosty, windy Winters.

Drought over the Summers is not uncommon, with water use restrictions, as is the risk of bushfires. Temperatures regularly reach into the high 30 degrees Celsius, and get into the 40s four months of the year (November, December, January and February).

At the other end of the scale, Winters get as low as -7 or -8 degrees Celsius anytime from May to September, with up to 16 days of frost in a month. 

Added to which, Canberra has clay soils which aren't ideal.
