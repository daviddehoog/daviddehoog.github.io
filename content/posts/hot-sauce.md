We have been looking for more condiments to add flavour to our meals. A special offer at the local market presented an opportunity to try fermenting a hot sauce.

The process is straight forward. 

Chop chillies or capsicum, some onion and garlic, cover with a brine solution and leave to ferment for 10-14 days. Once done, blitz the whole lot into a sauce and transfer to a sterilized, lidded container and store in the fridge. Since it will keep fermenting, slowly, a loose-lidded container is recommended.

One day, I'll be able to make a hot sauce like this using produce from the [garden]({{< ref "/topics/garden" >}}).

We do like some heat, but since this is a first attempt, this one is very much on the mild side.
