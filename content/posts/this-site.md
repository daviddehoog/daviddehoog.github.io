## the site

By design, this is a relatively simple web site.

I use a static site generator, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), to roll [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) files I have written into the website (HTML and CSS). The (default) ananke theme gives the files a consistent look and feel.

The content files and the [resulting website](http://daviddehoog.github.io) files are under version control with [git](https://git-scm.com), and synchronised with [GitHub](https://github.com). The site is actually built with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and served by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Most content is written in markdown, often on my phone or tablet on [Bear](https://bear.app) in quieter moments. I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to edit longer posts and to adjust Hugo configuration and template files.

All the code is available in [the siteâ€™s GitHub repository](https://github.com/daviddehoog/daviddehoog.github.io). Ideas for future features and content are stored as [issues](https://github.com/daviddehoog/daviddehoog.github.io/issues) in the repository.

The [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) has been very helpful for a new starter.

### Git workflow

Write content and add to main, fresh commit.

New site feautres are a branch - eg one branch per issue - then are tested and merged into main.Daily save as WIP.  Squash commits on a branch before merging into main and deploying.
