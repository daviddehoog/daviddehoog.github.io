I’m a middle-aged bureaucrat living in Canberra, Australia.
I enjoy cooking the seasons, riding bicycles, swimming and hiking and, when I can get away, travel - taking photographs, exploring cultures and food and drink. I dabble in statistics, data science and web application development - predominantly using open source software.
I am trying to get into designing and tending a garden. The pall of DIY projects casts a shadow over my future weekends.">

<p>I’m a middle-aged bureaucrat living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra?uselang=en">Canberra</a>, Australia.</p>
<p>I enjoy cooking the seasons, riding bicycles, swimming and hiking and, when I can get away, travel - taking photographs, exploring cultures and food and drink. I dabble in statistics, data science and web application development - predominantly using open source software.</p>
<p>I am trying to get into designing and tending a <a href="http://localhost:1313/topics/garden/">garden</a>. The pall of DIY projects casts a shadow over my future weekends.</p>
<p>The site is intended to be a fun, creative outlet for me. I have no formal training with these tools, nor is it how I make a living, so I bring the amateur’s expertise, accuracy and timeliness.</p>
<p>The site’s content is an erratically-assembled smorgasbord, featuring my hobbies, thoughts on other content that interests me, daily life with the occasional rant served on the side.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I should also make clear that nothing here is informed by the work do as an employee and is done in my own time. All views expressed here are my own and do not represent those of my employer.</p>
<h2 id="the-site">the site</h2>
<p>The site is my notebook on the Internet.</p>
<p><a href="">Posts</a> document things I&rsquo;ve found interesting or learned, so I can find them again later, and because by working in the open others can benefit.</p>
<p>This is a mini-blog, it is freed from the space constraints of a micro-blogging service and absent the expectations of well-formed blog with erudite and influential content.</p>
<p>Content will go on the site in whatever state is convenient for me - which includes early drafts, half-thoughts and questions I want to come back and answer. It will be polished enough for its purpose (which is to say, it may not be very polished).</p>
<p>There will be no logging in. There will be no advertising. There might be a cookie or two, but something basic to support limited JavaScript, if needed to do something nifty.</p>
<p>I have posted about the <a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/this-site/">tools, design and workflows used to create the site</a>.</p>
