About the site
This site is my notebook in the cloud. It exists partly so I can find useful and interesting things again and partly because by working in the open others can benefit. It is intended to be a fun, creative outlet for me. I have no formal training with these tools, nor is it how I make a living, so I bring the amateur’s expertise, accuracy and timeliness.">

<h2 id="about-the-site">About the site</h2>
<p>This site is my notebook in the cloud. It exists partly so I can find useful and interesting things again and partly because by working in the open others can benefit. It is intended to be a fun, creative outlet for me. I have no formal training with these tools, nor is it how I make a living, so I bring the amateur’s expertise, accuracy and timeliness.</p>
<p>The site’s content is an erratically assembled smorgasbord, featuring my hobbies, thoughts on other content that interests me, daily life and the occasional rant. Content will go on the site in whatever state is convenient for me - which includes early drafts, half-thoughts and questions I want to come back and answer. (There’s a vast network of websites out there with highly polished and influential nonsense, if that’s what you seek.).</p>
<p>Possible future content is included as <a href="https://github.com/daviddehoog/daviddehoog.github.io/issues">Issues</a> in <a href="https://github.com/daviddehoog/daviddehoog.github.io">the site’s GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>I should also make clear that nothing here is informed by the work do as an employee. All views expressed here are my own and do not represent those of my employer.</p>
