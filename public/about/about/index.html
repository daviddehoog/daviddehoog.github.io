I’m a middle-aged bureaucrat living in Canberra, Australia. I like to travel - taking photographs, exploring cultures, enjoying food and drink - and riding bicycles, swimming and hiking. I dabble in statistics, data science and web application development.
This site is my notebook in the cloud. It exists partly so I can find useful and interesting things again and partly because by working in the open others can benefit. It is intended to be a fun, creative outlet for me. I have no formal training with these tools, nor is it how I make a living, so I bring the amateur’s expertise, accuracy and timeliness.">

<p>I’m a middle-aged bureaucrat living in Canberra, Australia. I like to travel - taking photographs, exploring cultures, enjoying food and drink - and riding bicycles, swimming and hiking. I dabble in statistics, data science and web application development.</p>
<p>This site is my notebook in the cloud. It exists partly so I can find useful and interesting things again and partly because by working in the open others can benefit. It is intended to be a fun, creative outlet for me. I have no formal training with these tools, nor is it how I make a living, so I bring the amateur’s expertise, accuracy and timeliness.</p>
<p>The site’s content is an erratically assembled smorgasbord, featuring my hobbies, thoughts on other content that interests me, daily life and the occasional rant. Content will go on the site in whatever state is convenient for me - which includes early drafts, half-thoughts and questions I want to come back and answer. (There’s a vast network of websites out there with highly polished and influential nonsense, if that’s what you seek.).</p>
<p>Possible future content is included as <a href="https://github.com/daviddehoog/daviddehoog.github.io/issues">Issues</a> in <a href="https://github.com/daviddehoog/daviddehoog.github.io">the site’s GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>I should also make clear that nothing here is informed by the work do as an employee. All views expressed here are my own and do not represent those of my employer.</p>
<p>Consistent with the purpose of the site, material on the site is licensed under
<del><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International</a></del>. So, content can be used for pretty much anything, provided attribution is provided and the resulting materials are distributed under the same license. There may be other rights (eg. publicity, privacy, or moral rights) to which this license doesn’t apply.</p>
<h2 id="the-site-plumbing">The site plumbing</h2>
<p>For the reasons set out aboce, this is not a high-tech website.</p>
<ul>
<li>Uses the Hugo static site generator (written in Go). Hugo takes markdown files and rolls them into HTML, CSS (and JS). It uses the (default) X theme to give the sites files a consistent look and feel. Link to Hugo documentation.</li>
<li>The source files and the resulting website files are under version control with git, and synchronised with GitHub. Each time the main branch changes, a GitHub Action re-builds the site using the new content.</li>
<li>The resulting static website is about 600 kilobytes and is deployed to and served by a GitHub webserver.</li>
<li>Future possible include:
<ul>
<li>linting of the HTML and CSS output files, as part of the GitHub action</li>
<li>ensuring the website is accessible</li>
<li>building a custom Hugo theme</li>
<li>adding an RSS feed</li>
</ul>
</li>
